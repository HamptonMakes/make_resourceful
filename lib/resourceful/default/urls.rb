    # This file contains various methods to make URL helpers less painful.
    # They provide methods analogous to the standard foo_url and foo_path helpers.
    # However, they use make_resourceful's knowledge of the structure of the controller
    # to allow you to avoid figuring out which method to call and which parent objects it should be passed.

      #   object_path    #=> "/hats/12"
      #   hat_path(@hat) #=> "/hats/12"
