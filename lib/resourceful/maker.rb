    # This is the central method, and namesake, of make_resourceful.
    # It takes a block and evaluates it in the context of a Builder,
    # allowing the controller to be customized extensively.
    #
    # See Resourceful::Builder for documentation on the methods available
    # in the context of the block.
    #
    # The only option currently available is <tt>:include</tt>.
    # It takes an object that responds to to_proc
    # (or an array of such objects)
    # and evaluates that proc in the same context as the block.
    # For example:
    #
    #   make_resourceful :include => proc { actions :all } do
    #     before :show do
    #       current_object.current_user = current_user
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # This is the same as:
    #
    #   make_resourceful do
    #     actions :all
    #     before :show do
    #       current_object.current_user = current_user
    #     end
    #   end
